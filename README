Latest version available at: http://www.powarman.de/files/osdpip

See the file COPYING for license information.


Requirements:
-------------

- vdr 1.3.47 or higher, tested here with 1.4.7 and 1.6.0
- libavcodec from ffmpeg (http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net) version 0.4.8 or
  higher


Description:
------------

OSD Picture-in-Picture is a PlugIn that displays the current channel in a
small box on the screen (default upper right corner). You can switch up and
down now, watching the progress of the previous channel in the box. Quality is
not too good yet, and only I-Frames are displayed.
The plugin supports five modes:
 - greyscaled (16 shades of grey)
 - greyscaled (256 shades of grey)
 - 256 colors with fixed palette
 - 256 colors with dithering
 - 128 colors with variable palette
They all work with an ordinary vdr installation.
The plugin has the possibility to choose the PiP size (in the setup menu from
predefined sizes) and position (by moving it around using the cursor keys) as
well as crop dimensions.

ATTENTION: To have the position saved, you have to enter the plugin's setup
menu and hit the ok button.

The plugin lets you choose the MPEG frames to decode and display (in the setup
menu). For slower machines it is further possible to set an additional frame
dropping.

The plugin is able to show some channel and schedule info in a second window
when switching channels. In setup menu you can change it's position, size and
the amount of information shown.


Installation:
-------------

Let's say osdpip's version is 0.0.9 and vdr's version is 1.4.0. If you
use anything else please exchange the version numbers appropriately (this
way I don't have to update this section all the times;) ).

cd vdr-1.4.0/PLUGINS/src
tar xvfz vdr-osdpip-0.0.9.tgz
ln -s osdpip-0.0.9 osdpip
cd ../..

If you have ffmpeg installed, "make plugins" should do just fine now, but if
you have it next to your vdr folder (e.g. as the DXR3 plugin needs it), you
have to compile with "make FFMPEG_STATIC=1 plugins". Ffmpeg must then be
present in a folder (or symlink) called "ffmpeg".

In recent FFMPEG versions the functions img_convert and img_replace where
replaced by swscale functions. This are used by default. If you don't want to
use swscale functions for scaling and color format conversions, you will have
to add WITHOUT_SWSCALE=1 to your Make.config or uncomment this line in
vdr-osdpip's Makefile. Then deprecated img_convert and img_resample will be
used instead.

If you have a recent FFMPEG version that has a changed structure of its header
files you will have to add WITH_NEW_FFMPEG_HEADERS=1 to your Make.config or
uncomment this line in vdr-osdpip's Makefile.
