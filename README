Latest version available at: http://www.magoa.net/linux/index.php?view=osdpip

See the file COPYING for license information.


Requirements:

- libmpeg2 (http://libmpeg2.sourceforge.net) version 0.4.0 (OLDER VERSIONS 
  DON'T WORK)


Description:

OSD Picture-in-Picture is a PlugIn that displays the current channel in a 
small box on the screen (default upper right corner). You can switch up and 
down now, watching the progress of the previous channel in the box. Quality is 
not too good yet, and only I-Frames are displayed. You'll need to upgrade your
VDR to support a 256 color OSD with the provided patching instruction.


Installation:

Let's say osdpip's version is 0.0.1 and vdr's version is 1.2.6. If you 
use anything else please exchange the version numbers appropriately (this
way I don't have to update this section all the times;) ).

cd vdr-1.2.6/PLUGINS/src
tar xvfz vdr-osdpip-0.0.1.tgz
ln -s osdpip-0.0.1 osdpip
cd ../..

Now, you have to call your favourite editor to open osdbase.h and jump to line
number 16. I don't provide a patch here because some patches already touch that
area. Well this one's easy, though. Just increase the number of colors in this
line to 256.

#define MAXNUMCOLORS 256

Now, you have to re-build VDR and Plugins.

make [options, if necessary] vdr
make [options, if necessary] plugins


Controls:

Up/Down    Switch Channel up/down
1-9        Set Box Position
0          Switch back to PiP channel and exit PiP
Back       Exit PiP without switching back
